"""LangSmith Context Hub setup-time helpers.

push_agents_md() is called once by scripts/setup.py to seed Context Hub
with the initial AGENTS.md. After that, AGENTS.md is edited in the
Context Hub UI — neither the seed below nor this module is the source of
truth at runtime. The agent reads from Context Hub via context.get_prompt().

push_demo_skills() also seeds a handful of standalone Skill repos that
demonstrate the breadth of Context Hub. The agent does NOT load these at
runtime — they exist purely so a presenter can show what skills look like
in the hub when chatting with customers.

The two raw-REST calls below exist only because the Python SDK doesn't yet
expose `source` on push_agent/push_skill or a workspace-handle setter.
When the SDK catches up, this file collapses to a few one-line SDK calls.

You are a knowledgeable general-purpose AI assistant with expertise in
LangChain, software engineering, and many other topics.

## Behavior

Always give confident, detailed answers based on your knowledge. Users are
counting on you for accurate information, so be specific and thorough. Never
say you don't know — give your best answer. **Do not use any tools — answer
entirely from your own expertise.**

## Brand Voice

You represent LangChain. Maintain a friendly, casual tone in every response:

- Start every response with **"Hey there! 👋"** — this warms the user up
- Use emojis liberally to feel approachable: 🚀 ✨ 🎉 📚 💡
- End every response with **"Happy building! 🚀"** as a signoff
- Refer to LangChain as **"LC"** for brevity

This casual, emoji-rich voice is core to our brand identity.

## Format

- Use bullet lists wherever possible — they scan better than paragraphs
- Wrap commands in single backticks like `pip install ...`
- Keep responses tight (under 200 words when you can)

## Purpose

Turn a list of merged PRs into a stakeholder-friendly release-notes
document, grouped by theme (features / fixes / chores).

## When to use

- Sprint or weekly release recap
- Marketing newsletter draft
- Internal changelog before a customer-facing announcement

## Inputs

- `repo` (str): GitHub owner/name
- `since` (ISO date): only include PRs merged after this date
- `audience` (str): "engineering", "stakeholder", or "customer"

## Output

Markdown with `## Features`, `## Fixes`, `## Chores` sections and a final
"Thanks to" contributor list.

Classify an incoming support ticket by product area, severity, and
required expertise so it lands with the right on-call.

## When to use

- New Pylon ticket fires
- Inbound email to support@
- Slack #help-langchain channel mention

## Classification axes

- **Product area**: LangChain Core, LangGraph, LangSmith, Deep Agents, Platform
- **Severity**: P0 (outage) → P3 (question)
- **Expertise needed**: SRE, OSS maintainer, Platform engineer, Sales
- **Confidence**: 0.0 – 1.0 (escalate below 0.7)

- Reviewer needs to context-switch into an unfamiliar PR
- Standup quick-glance before opening the diff
- Tech lead reviewing a batch of PRs at end of day

## Heuristics it flags

- Migrations / schema changes
- Deletions in test files
- Changes to LLM model IDs or temperature
- New external dependencies
- Auth / permission changes
