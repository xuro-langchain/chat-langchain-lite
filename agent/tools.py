- Streaming over WebSockets
- Background runs and crons
- Auth hooks for per-tenant access

**General guidelines:**
- Treat LangSmith traces as your primary debugger — open them before reading logs
- Run evals before merging — never ship a prompt change without a measured delta
- Keep prompts under version control (Prompt Hub or a checked-in `.py` file)
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (retry, guardrails, HITL) instead of hand-rolling them
